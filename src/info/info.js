    about: `
        I love building things, I'm doing it now using web technologies and 
        loving my learning adventure with React.
        I've been involved in coding for a few years, from teaching Arduino and being 
        a team coach for robotics competitions to work developing a web application to
        record and analize biosignals and also do some research on automatic smell recognition
        using machine learning and signal processing.
    `,
    looking: `
        I´m currently looking for remote positions for frontend development, mainly React related but 
        willing to learn any other technologies the passion to solve problems using code has taught me 
        to never stop learning.
    `,
    checkout: `
        Checkout my projects, I also share what I´m currently learning and some resources of the topics
        I´ve taught in previous years.
